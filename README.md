Demo Video: This project represents my first attempt at using Streamlit to deploy a machine learning model locally on my machine (localhost). I also explored deployment on Streamlit Cloud; however, the pickle model file was approximately 500 MB, exceeding GitHubâ€™s 100 MB file size limit, which prevented successful deployment. I explored alternative approaches but encountered similar challenges. I am continuing to learn and improve my deployment skills, and I plan to deploy models from future projects to Streamlit Cloud successfully.
